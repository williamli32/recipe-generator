# HOW TO INSTALL

1. Create an empty directory anywhere, and cd into the directory.
2. Move our submitted zip file to the newly created empty directory
3. Unzip the file using the command `unzip recipe.zip`
4. Open the code directory: type `code .`
5. To see the interface, run `make recipe` in the terminal and follow the instructions.

### AVOIDING POTENTIAL ERRORS
- Make sure you have OCaml installed before running `make recipe`.
- `make build` does not work as of now - do not run that command.
- We named our zip file "recipe.zip". If the name got changed during submission, then the command in step 3 will not work. If this happens, run the command `unzip [name].zip` where [name] is the name of our submitted zip file as it appears.
